ready-to-paste microcopy (steal these)

	•	“Dispatch cutoff: Order in 3h 12m for this week’s truck.”
	•	“Final run: Retiring Thu, 26 Sep—no restock planned.”

⸻

guardrails (to keep it ‘best ever’, not spammy)
	•	Be truthful. Never fake timers, counters, or social proof. If data is unavailable, hide the widget.
	•	Cap pressure. Limit to 1 urgency + 1 proof element visible at once to avoid fatigue.
	•	Respect time zones. All timers in IST with exact dates (e.g., “Thu, 26 Sep”).
	•	Gated pricing stays gated. “Login to view trade pricing” pairs well with early access.
	•	Show exit paths. “Not ready? Save catalog” reduces bounce without killing urgency.

⸻

what to track (so FOMO actually works)
	•	Primary: Account sign-ups, Add-to-Cart rate, Checkout start, Orders.
	•	Secondary: Clicks on Early-Access, Waitlist joins, Time on PDP, WhatsApp CTA taps.
	•	Quality: Refund/cancellation rate (ensure FOMO isn’t pushing bad fits).

⸻

A/B tests to run first (simple & high-win)
	1.	Low-stock threshold: show at ≤3 vs ≤5 sets → measure PDP→ATC.
	2.	Cutoff framing: “Dispatch cutoff in 3:12:33” vs “Dispatch today if ordered soon”.
	3.	Early-access duration: 24h vs 48h preview → sign-ups & ATC.
	4.	Territory cap copy: “Limited city slots” vs “City allocation program”.
	5.	Proof type: “recently added” count vs “concurrent viewers”.

⸻

ethical scarcity ideas (B2B-friendly)
	•	Production batches (genuine): show batch number & ETA.
	•	Seasonal retirement: last run before festivals.
	•	MOQ perks with genuine cap: first 50 only, then auto-expire.
	•	Territory light exclusivity: limited active retailers per city per catalog.

⸻

quick plug-and-play set (use these five together)
	1.	Sticky bar: “Order in X:XX for this week’s dispatch.”
	2.	PDP badge: “Final run—retiring [DATE].”
	3.	Counter: “Only [N] sets left for quick dispatch.”
	4.	Proof chip: “[M] retailers added this today.”
	5.	Perk bar (cart): “Free swatch pack—[K] left for this week.”
